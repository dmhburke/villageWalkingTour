    Washington Square Park has a pivotal connection to the Greenwich Village counterculture of the 50s, 60s and 70s.

    <br><br>Originally built on marsh ground that was fed by the Minetta stream (a site we'll visit later), its central location and large area has made it a focal point of public demonstrations as well as counterculture performances.

    <br><br><div class="brownText boldText headerPadding">The Beat poets</div>
    In the 50s and 60s it was a popular meeting place for both the Beat poet generation and for folk singers, especially once the park was again closed to traffic in the 60s.

    <br><br>Indeed, it was so popular at one point, that the city sought to ban artists and singers from congregating in the park in 1961, the year that Bob Dylan arrived in New York.
    <div class=imgBlock id="protestIMG"></div>
    But the protesters prevailed, and it remained an important hub for counterculture art.
    <br><br>Perhaps the most important artistic style in the late 50s was Beat poetry, which describes a largely free verse, often surrelistic, poetry style that began in the 1940s and rose to subculture prominence through the 50s and 60s.
    <br><br>The connection between Beat poetry and the Folk music culture we're going to explore in the Village, was an important one, led by the two defining figures of the Beat poetry movement: Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.
    <div class=imgBlock id="ginsbergIMG"></div>
    Ginsberg, who first came to prominence in 1956 with publication of Howl, "an outcry against everything in our mechanistic civilization which kills the spirit", was a prominent figure in the the Village and here in Washington Square Park.
    <div class=quoteBlock id="">
      I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,<br>
      dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,<br>
      angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,<br>
      who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,</div>

    Howl is stil referenced as a defining work of the movement, and - to give you an idea of how transformational this approach to poetry was at the time - was actually declared an offensive and obscene work by the San Francisco Police department, who arrested its publisher.

    <br><br><div class="brownText boldText headerPadding">Beat poetry and Bob Dylan</div>
    Beat poetry was as much a social movement as an artistic one, representing a battle against the social conformity of the post-war age, expressed through a rejection of academic and structural formality in poetry.

    <br><br>And the Beat poet movement had a profound impact on Bob Dylan, even before he moved to New York. He had been given a copy of Jack Kerouac's work in 1959, and he felt it was the first poetry he'd ever read that spoke his own American language. "It blew my mind", Dylan told Ginsberg when he met him in the Village in the 60s, and who became something of a Village mentor to Dylan.
    <div class=imgBlock id="dylanBeatIMG"></div>
    As Dylan recalled:
    <div class=quoteBlock id="">
    "I came out of the wilderness (Minnesota) and just naturally fell in with the Beat scene, the bohemian, Be Bop crowd, it was all pretty much connected."</div>
    The influence of Beat poetry can be found in much of Dylan's work, and not just in what Dylan called the "breathless, dynamic phrases" of their performance style.
    <br><br>More importantly, it can be found in the adoption of the harsher edge of their social critiques, a tone that Dylan embraced and which separated Dylan from much of the more folksy popular Left wing artists of the time.
